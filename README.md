# README

This is a data science project that made use of a dataset containing information about the 6 first pok√©mon generations. In this project, I have made use of tools like Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy and sklearn), Jupyter notebooks, statistical inference, clustering algorithms, git and github pages. The full report can be accessed [here](https://mateusmelo821.github.io/Pokemon-Generations-Analysis/).
